      <description>This dataset is a collection of JPEG pictures of famous people collected over the internet, all details are available on the official website:
http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/
The purpose in this project is to recognize the face of person in the picture and label it with its full name, based on a training process composed by thousand of labeled pictures.
For this project, all picture are black &amp;amp; white (sklearn.datasets.fetch_lfw_people &amp;ndash; parameter color = False)</description>

      <description>In this project, ml-latest-small dataset is used to cluster users. This is as useful tool for movie makers and companies as Netflix. Here, users rate movies using a 0-5 scores. The objective is to find clusters that group users based on the movies they like/dislike using KMeans technic.
ml-latest-small dataset contains 100836 ratings and 3683 tag applications across 9742 movies. These data were created by 610 users between March 29, 1996 and September 24, 2018.</description>

      <description>Many companies directs marketing campaings to all their leads. However, the effect of this campaings could be different from one potencial customer to other. So, what if marketing teams could have the possibility to predict which customer will buy from the mass of clients???
Well, in this analysis we try to create a model that allow us to predict who is going to buy a bank service and who is not.</description>

      <description>It is well known that wine has motivated people to socialize, create, party, and adventure. Itâ€™s no wonder, billions of people around the globe identify as wine lovers!
In this dataset, we find 1600 wine references with the following features and the goal is to create clusters that group references by similarity. This way, we could classify a new wine reference, that has not been included in this analysis, in one of the clusters defined here.</description>

      <description>Marketing teams usually promote their products in different kind of media. For example: TV, radio, newspaper, social media, etc. However, the impact in sales could be different for each kind of media. Perharps, investing in TV or radio would generate a bigger sales growth than investing in newspaper!! In this repository, you will find a model to predict sales based on different kind of media and also, it will help to identify which kind of advertising should be performed by the company.</description>
